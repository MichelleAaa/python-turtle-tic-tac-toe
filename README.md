## Launch Instructions

Clone or download this repository to your local machine. 

Please verify that python has been installed on your machine. If it hasn't, please visit [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for installation instructions.

Open the file folder in VS code.

Click on the tic-tac-toe.py file so it opens in the right window view. 

Right click anywhere in the code and select "Run Python File in Terminal".

A new window will appear which will show the game board and instructions.

## Reflection

I created this application after finishing the Python courses in NuCamp's Back End, SQL, and DevOps Developer with Python bootcamp. After reviewing tutorials on modules I decided to code this with turtle as it's a relatively beginner-friendly option. The random, functools, and time modules were also added in to increase functionality. To make the game harder to win a detailed computer_turn function was coded instead of relying on only a random number selection. The function will more aggressively block player wins and look for it's own wins.
